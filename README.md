# JekyllPugAssets
## Jekyll with Pug and Assets
This is the basic jekyll site, built with pug and jekyll assets.
The layouts have been converted to pug, more conversions ongoing.
Additionally, livereloading is enabled via the jekyll-hawkins plugin.
So to work on this base, simply run:

```bash
jekyll liveserve
```

**Contributions welcome.**

## Requirements
You'll need pug installed. A yarn file setup for netlify will be up soon as well.
